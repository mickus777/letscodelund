Next challenge 8:

Public key encryption

All programmers (and everyone else?) should know the basics of encryption and safe communication.
This task is to write code capable of encrypting and decrypting an arbitrary text, using some
public key encryption technique. 

A place to look for a simple algorith for this can be "Diffieâ€“Hellman":
