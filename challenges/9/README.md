Next challenge 9:

Integer maths

How are integers maths actually computed on a bit-level?

The task this time is to make your own implementation of an integer, maybe of arbitrary size and
create functions for the basic operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
At least as many as you have time for.
