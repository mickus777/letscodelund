Dynamic Time Warping implementation
===================================

index.html has a basic implementation. Choose two files containing only list of numbers (like Rickard's first samples) and press Compare.  

signature.html has an implementation that compares a sequence of points, so you can try to fake my signature, or compare drawings.

Actual DTW code is in dtw.js
