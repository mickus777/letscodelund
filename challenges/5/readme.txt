L-system
========
(Lindenmayer system)

An L-system is a type of formal grammar invented by Astrid Lindenmayer to model the growth of 
plants.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system for an introduction.


Challenge:
----------

Write a program that can take an L-system, execute it for a number of iterations and then output
this in some visual form, perhaps with svg-files or possibly just text.

Experiment a bit with it and try to create something lifelike.
