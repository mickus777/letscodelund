Lets code Lund is a private group, with a public result.
We do what we like, to become better programmers.


Next challenge 10:

de Bruijn-sequence

The task is to generate a de Bruijn-sequence of order n on a k-sized alphabet.
Our generated sequences might not be identical (even if we use same n and k), 
but they should at least be equally long.
